  abstract = {We introduce partial sessions and partial (multiparty) session types, in order to deal with open systems, i.e., systems with missing components. Partial sessions can be composed, and the type of the resulting system is derived from those of its components without knowing any suitable global type nor the types of missing parts. Incompatible types, due to e.g. miscommunications or deadlocks, are detected at the merging phase. We apply these types to a process calculus, for which we prove subject reduction and progress, so that well-typed systems never violate the prescribed constraints. Therefore, partial session types support the development of systems by incremental assembling of components.},

  abstract = {We present the syntax, semantics, typing, subtyping, unification, refinement, and REPL of Bull, a prototype theorem prover based on the Delta-Framework, i.e. a fully-typed Logical Framework à la Edinburgh LF decorated with union and intersection types, as described in previous papers by the authors. Bull also implements a subtyping algorithm for the Type Theory Xi of Barbanera-Dezani-de’Liguoro. Bull has a command-line interface where the user can declare axioms, terms, and perform computations and some basic terminal-style features like error pretty-printing, subexpressions highlighting, and file loading. Moreover, it can typecheck a proof or normalize it. These terms can be incomplete, therefore the typechecking algorithm uses unification to try to construct the missing subterms. Bull uses the syntax of Berardi’s Pure Type Systems to improve the compactness and the modularity of the kernel. Abstract and concrete syntax are mostly aligned and similar to the concrete syntax of Coq. Bull uses a higher-order unification algorithm for terms, while typechecking and partial type inference are done by a bidirectional refinement algorithm, similar to the one found in Matita and Beluga. The refinement can be split into two parts: the essence refinement and the typing refinement. Binders are implemented using commonly-used de Bruijn indices. We have defined a concrete language syntax that will allow user to write Delta-terms. We have defined the reduction rules and an evaluator. We have implemented from scratch a refiner which does partial typechecking and type reconstruction. We have experimented Bull with classical examples of the intersection and union literature, such as the ones formalized by Pfenning with his Refinement Types in LF and by Pierce. We hope that this research vein could be useful to experiment, in a proof theoretical setting, forms of polymorphism alternatives to Girard’s parametric one.},

  abstract = {We present the Delta-calculus, an explicitly typed lambda-calculus with strong pairs, projections and explicit type coercions. The calculus can be parametrized with different intersection type theories T, e.g. the Coppo-Dezani, the Coppo-Dezani-Sall\'e, the Coppo-Dezani-Venneri and the Barendregt-Coppo-Dezani ones, producing a family of Delta-calculi with related intersection type systems. We prove the main properties like Church-Rosser, unicity of type, subject reduction, strong normalization, decidability of type checking and type reconstruction. We state the relationship between the intersection type assignment systems \`a la Curry and the corresponding intersection type systems \`a la Church by means of an essence function translating an explicitly typed Delta-term into a pure lambda-term one. We finally translate a Delta-term with type coercions into an equivalent one without them; the translation is proved to be coherent because its essence is the identity. The generic Delta-calculus can be parametrized to take into account other intersection type theories as the ones in the Barendregt et al. book.},

  abstract = {We introduce a dependent-type theory $\Delta$-framework, LF-$\Delta$ , based on the Edinburgh Logical Framework LF, extended with the strong proof-functional connectives intersection, union, and relevant implication. Proof-functional connectives take into account the shape of logical proofs, thus allowing the user to reflect polymorphic features of proofs in formulae. This is in contrast to classical and intuitionistic connectives where the meaning of a compound formula is dependent only on the truth value or the provability of its subformulae. Both Logical Frameworks and Proof Functional Logics consider proofs as first class citizens albeit differently. The former mention proofs explicitly, while the latter mention proofs implicitly. Their combination therefore opens up new possibilites of formal reasoning on proof-theoretic semantics. We study the metatheory of LF-$\Delta$ and provide various examples of applications. Moreover, we discuss a prototype implementation of a type checker and a refiner allowing the user to accelerate and possibly automate, the proof development process. This proof-functional type theory can be plugged in existing common proof assistants.},

The theory of the system is under investigation. Once validated in vitro, the proof-functional type theory can be successfully plugged in existing truth-functional proof assistants.},

This is in contrast to classical truth-functional connectives where the meaning of a compound formula is dependent only on the truth value of its subformulas. We present a proof-functional logic and we give a semantics using Mints' realizers accounting for intersection types, union types, and subtyping. The semantics interprets the type $\omega$ as the set universe, the $\rightarrow$ type as a function space, the $\wedge$ and $\vee$ types as set intersection and set union, respectively, and the subtype relation as a subset operator. Using the proof-as-types and terms-as-propositions paradigms, we extend the typed calculus previously defined by the authors with a decidable subtyping relation and we show this calculus to be isomorphic to the Barbanera-Dezani-Ciancaglini-de'Liguoro type assignment system. A subtyping algorithm is presented and proved to be sound and complete. Hindley gave a subtyping algorithm for intersection types but, as far as we know, there is no system in the literature also including union types.},

                  with products, coproducts, and a related
                  proof-functional logic. This calculus, directly
                  derived from a typed calculus previously defined by
                  two of the current authors, has been proved

                  featuring two proof-functional connectives, namely
                  strong conjunction and strong disjunction.  We prove
                  the typed calculus to be isomorphic to the logic
